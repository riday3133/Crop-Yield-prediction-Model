Built a crop yield prediction model implementing regression and classification algorithms.
Employed regression techniques like linear regression, Gaussian Process regression, and classification methods including logistic regression, perceptron, sigmoid neuron, and multi-layer perceptron (MLP).
Achieved superior accuracy with the algorithm, reaching 90% for prediction.
